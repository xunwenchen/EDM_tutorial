# EDM_tutorial

This repository contains the code and data for the tutorial on Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM).
The main purpose is to provide a hands-on tutorial for postgraduate students and researchers interested in learning how to apply EDM to ecological research.

The tutorial is divided into the following sections: 

1. Data preparation: This section provides a brief introduction to the data used in the tutorial and how to prepare it for the analysis.

2. simplex: This section provides a brief introduction to the simplex projection and how to use it to reconstruct the state space of a system.

3. S-map: This section provides a brief introduction to the S-map model and how to use it to predict the future state of a system.

4. Multiview distance regularised (MDR) S-map for high-dimensional data, such as microbial communities under external disturbance.

5. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) for detecting causal relationships between time series data, for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional data.

The tutorial is based on the following paper:
